[00:10.33] Now, just now I know that I'm happy
[00:15.02] Because you're here with me
[00:20.37] You, just you is what I really need
[00:25.19] And all the other thought means nothing to me
[00:47.69] 
[00:29.70] 'Love' is the word I really need
[00:34.72] Because all the other word
[00:37.22] Means nothing to me
[00:39.62] 'Love' is the word I really need
[00:44.40] Because all the other words
[00:47.19] Just makes me tell lies
[00:58.69] 
[00:52.26] By my side, by my side, by my side
[00:56.76] Stay by my side, by my side
[01:01.64] Stay by my side, by my side, by my side
[01:06.71] Stay by my side, by my side
[01:20.21] 
[01:21.67] Now, just now I know that I'm lonely
[01:26.11] Because you're away from me
[01:31.52] You, about you, about me is about you
[01:35.74] And I'll repeat the same verses over
[01:38.84] And over and over again
[01:41.31] Untill you're back to me
[01:53.31] 
[01:46.95] 'Love' is the word I really need
[01:51.18] So all of these affections need
[01:53.83] A place where to go
[01:56.56] Love' is the word I really need
[02:01.15] So please will you come back
[02:03.59] And kiss on my cheek
[02:13.59] 
[02:08.42] By my side, by my side, by my side
[02:13.06] Stay by my side, by my side
[02:17.97] Stay by my side, by my side, by my side
[02:23.05] Stay by my side, by my side (ouh-u)
[02:40.55] 
[02:28.37] 流るる意思を以て
[02:37.91] 動かぬ意味を越え
[02:46.67] 僕には二つ心臓がある
[02:56.13] 君を思うと動き出すのが
[03:01.63] 
[03:09.70] By my side, by my side, by my side
[03:14.37] Stay by my side, by my side
[03:19.75] By my side, by my side, by my side
[03:24.32] Stay by my side, by my side
[03:29.10] Stay by my side, by my side, by my side
[03:34.25] Stay by my side, by my side
[03:47.75] 
[03:50.01] You told me that you're mine and
[03:51.97] You always kissed me instead of H
[03:54.01] But this doesn't mean that I'm head
[03:57.26] Over toes in with you whatever
[04:00.08] You used to beg me hug and
[04:02.59] You used to play me tricks
[04:04.47] And all those hugs and tricks we
[04:06.50] Shared is now what we call a broken dreams
[04:27.50] 
[04:10.03] I hate myself when my brain
[04:12.71] Tells me that I'm lying
[04:14.71] That everything we went
[04:16.59] Through was just a waste of a time
[04:19.60] So I'm writing this for you
[04:21.15] And I'm writing this for me
[04:34.65] 
[04:24.76] With in full of thanks and tears
[04:26.95] And a pair of ring full of, I love you
[04:30.05] This song will almost end
[04:32.28] But that doesn't mean us too
[04:34.72] Well, just in case someday
[04:36.83] You come to me and says Hi
